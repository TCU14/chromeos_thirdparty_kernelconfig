# ChromeOS kernel configs (both stock and the Linux patched version)

The master branch has all testing changes that have not been fully tested whereas Stable has the current known good configuration for a kernel. I recommend grabbing a third party release 4.4 kernel from https://chromium.googlesource.com with the tag of the current stable ChromeOS release (EG, R74)
